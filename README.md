# Natyla Docker Image

This is the Git repo of a Natyla Docker Image. For those of you who do not know what [Natyla](https://github.com/Fersca/natyla/) is it is a Full-Stack REST-API/Cache/Key-Value-Store application with which you can have an API running in just a few minutes. I created this docker image so it can be even easier to deploy an API with docker.
